			<p class="text-primary" style="padding-top:5px;">Hello, my name is Keegan. I am the front-end developer of this application. I am excited
				to work on this project with Brian and Sage. Throughout this whole project he have had to overcome some obsticles.
				We really haven't worked with a team in school and the senior project finally joins a group of computer science majors
				to work on a significant application that benifits other people. When tasked with this application, my eyes grew big.
				I thought this was an opprotunity of a life time to work on a government project during school. Who gets to do that
				while still in school. I am greatful working with a team that has passion for this project and I look forward to
				completing this application.
